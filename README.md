# Sentimental-Analysis-Model

# Overview
The sentimental analysis model was built with the use of Deep learning application of Tensorflow

# Summary
In this Project i engaged the use of Sentimental Analysis in Text Dataset, which was drawn from social media, feelings, emotions.The source of the dataset is called CrownFlower
and i downloaded it from Data.World . In this project i made use of Tensorflow package for Deep Learning(DL) to vectorization and embedded the words into numbers of sequences to make prediction of the outputs.
